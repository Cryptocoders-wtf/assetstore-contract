# Decentralized Autonomous Marketplace (DAM)

Satoshi Nakajima - Sep 17, 2022

The blockchain is a gift from Satoshi Nakamoto, but we still haven't found the killer application, 
which offers huge value to our society and changes our business practices or even our lifestyle. 

I'd like to present one idea, Decentralized Autonomous Marketplace (DAM), 
which has a potential to become such a killer application. 

Here is the definition of a Decentralized Autonomous Marketplace (DAM).

1. A DAM is a marketplace of digital assets (= contents), such as images, videos, music, 3d models, or even data sets.
2. All sales transactions on a DAM are processed by its smart contract autonomously. 
3. Its smart contract defines the revenue distribution rules (among creators and other contributors).
4. The revenue distribution will be done immediately as part of each sales transaction.
5. All the required gas fees (including the revenue distribution) will be paid by the buyer. 
6. The payee of a revenue distribution might be another smart contract, which has its own revenue distribution mechanism (nested revenue distribution). 

Because all the sales transactions and associated revenue distributions are processed by smart contract autonomously, a DAM has several advantages over existing marketplaces. 

1. Zero labor cost
2. No middle man
3. Transparent revenue distibution rules
4. Public record of revenue disributions
5. Zero audit cost
6. No operator (fully decentralized)
7. Perpetual

I am in the process of developing the first instance of DAM, which allows creators to publish their drawings to the on-chain asset store and generate revenue from them (Draw2Earn application).
