# TLTR

A few months ago, I have deployed a mechanism to efficiently store vector assets on the blockchain (mainnet), which will make it easy and affordable to release fully on-chain NFTs. It also allows other developers to re-use those assets.

As the second step, I am building a Decentralized Autonomous Marketplace (DAM), which distributes revenues from those assets to appropriate parties autonomously.

# Project Summary

- **SVG Compression**: An algorithm to compress SVG data very efficiently (deployed)
- **On-Chain Asset Store**: A smart contract that acts as the storage service of vector assets (deployed)
- **Crowd Minting**: A method to get help from a crowd to upload a large set of vector images to the blockchain (deployed)
- **Asset Composer**: A smart contract that performs the composition of assets and the distribution of revenue (beta)
- **Asset Provider**: An interface, which allows smart contracts to provide vector assets and receive royalty payments (beta)
- **On-Chain Vector Editor**: A WebUI front-end, which allows the user to edit vector data and perform compositions of existing assets (beta)
- **CC Share-Earnings**: A new type of Creative Commons license, which enables autonomous revenue sharing (draft proposal)
- **Generative Asset Providers**: Any smart contracts which act as an Asset Provider (work in progress)
- **Decentralized Autonomous Marketplace**: A marketplace that allows Asset Providers to offer their vector assets and receive royalties from generated revenue autonomously (beta)

# Open-source, Non-profit

This is a **non-profit** effort (at least so far), and the entire source code is open to public: [smart contracts](https://github.com/Cryptocoders-wtf/assetstore-contract), [WebUI](https://github.com/Cryptocoders-wtf/assetstore)

# What I am looking for

Any feedbacks, discussions, code reviews, beta testings, and participation are welcome.
