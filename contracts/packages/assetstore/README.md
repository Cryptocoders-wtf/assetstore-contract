# On-Chain AssetStore

The On-chain Asset Store is a *smart contract*, which acts as the public on-chain asset storage service, allowing developers to store and share vector assets.

It stores various vector data in the compressed format described above, and makes them available to other smart contracts, just like the asset store for Unity 3D engine.
